The inputs of Graspot are multiple spatial transcriptomics slices with gene expression matrices and spatial coordinates. The outputs of Graspot are probabilistic alignment T and common integrated space aligns intrinsic structures of multiple ST slices. Probabilistic alignment matrix T guides the coordinate alignment using weighted ICP algorithm.
