# Graspot
Graspot: A graph attention network for spatial transcriptomics data integration with optimal transport
[overview_graspot_pdf.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15987449/overview_graspot_pdf.pdf)
The inputs of Graspot are multiple spatial transcriptomics slices with gene expression matrices and spatial coordinates. The outputs of Graspot are probabilistic alignment T and common integrated space aligns intrinsic structures of multiple ST slices. Probabilistic alignment matrix T guides the coordinate alignment using weighted ICP algorithm.
